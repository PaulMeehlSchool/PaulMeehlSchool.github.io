We are excited to announce that registration is now open for the workshop "Causal Inference and Variable Control". In this workshop, Peder Isager will provide a practical guide and hands-on practices to create strong derivation chains from a causal theory to a statistical hypothesis, and vice versa. Then, he will cover approaches and challenges of causal inference based on observational data.
