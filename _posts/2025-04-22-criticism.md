We are excited to announce that registration is now open for the last workshop this academic year, “Scientific Criticism and Peer Review”. In this session, René Bekkers will offer a hands-on introduction to the process of reviewing scientific papers. Participants will gain a deeper understanding of how peer review works as a quality assurance mechanism in science, learn to recognize both effective and problematic review practices, and reflect on ways the peer review system can be improved.
