We are excited to announce that registration is now open for the workshop "Open Qualitative Research". In this workshop, Sarahanne Field will provide a practical guide to designing, conducting, and reporting qualitative studies with a strong emphasis on openness. She will also discuss the key challenges in open qualitative data, including ethical concerns, participant privacy, and tensions between openness and contextual integrity. This workshop is geared towards junior researchers in the social and behavioural sciences who are relatively new to qualitative research and who want to learn how to start a qualitative project, as well as integrate open science principles into their qualitative work without compromising depth and nuance.
