## Course Description

Are you navigating the complexities of qualitative research and looking for ways to enhance transparency and rigor? This workshop aims to provide a practical guide to designing, conducting, and reporting qualitative studies with a strong emphasis on openness.

We’ll cover:

- Approaching a qualitative study – Making choices that align with your research needs and philosophy of science
- Setting up your study – Designing studies with transparency and reproducibility in mind
- Preregistering qualitative research – Strategies for planning and documenting analytical decisions
- Reflexivity in open science – Navigating researcher positionality
- Interpretation and reporting – Balancing rich, contextualized insights with reproducibility

We'll also explore key challenges in open qualitative data, including ethical concerns, participant privacy, and tensions between openness and contextual integrity.

This workshop is geared towards researchers in the social and behavioural sciences who want to integrate open science principles into qualitative work without compromising depth and nuance.

## Prerequisites 

The skill level of the intended participant is beginner/novice (we will be starting together ‘from scratch’, essentially), but there are interesting discussions to be had for more experienced qualitative researchers interested in the challenges of open qualitative research in the second part of the workshop. 
We will use **Atlas.ti** (the free trial browser-based version) in the workshop. If you have your own qualitative dataset, bring it along so you can practice on it. If not (which will be the case for many of you), no worries - toy qualitative datasets will also be provided, which you can use to practice on.
