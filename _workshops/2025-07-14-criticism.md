## Course Description

During a PhD, you will attempt to publish your work in scientific journals. What can you expect from the scientific criticism that you receive in peer review? How should you deal with comments, suggestions and requests from editors and reviewers? What do journals expect from peer reviewers, and how can you write a good review?

The session explores how peer review works in practice, detailing the roles of authors, editors, and reviewers throughout the review process—from manuscript submission to revision and resubmission. It highlights the gap between ideal research integrity standards and real-world practices by analyzing flaws in published papers and discussing why peer review doesn't always guarantee research quality. Participants will evaluate these shortcomings and brainstorm ways to improve the system as well as how it can be made more effective and fair. Several potential interventions will be discussed, including structured reporting guidelines, automated and open peer review, financial or other incentives for reviewers, and a more distributed approach to reviewer responsibilities.

**Learning objectives**

At the end of this session, you will have 1) improved your knowledge and understanding of how peer review works in practice as a form of quality control in science; 2) you will be able to identify poor and best practices in peer review; 3) you will have formed an opinion on how peer review can be improved.

Beyond the current session, the insights in peer review help you become a good reviewer, and recognize good research practices. By reviewing manuscripts, you will learn what the current scholarship is about, and how ongoing research is done. As a reviewer you will not only help uphold standards for good research in your field, but also learn where the current frontier of knowledge is.
