## Course Description

Collaboration is at the heart of good science. As research teams grow in
size, diversity, and speed, the need for structured, transparent, and
efficient collaboration increasesâ€”especially in the face of rising
demands for scientific rigor and reproducibility. This half-day workshop
teaches participants how to apply techniques from agile software
development to the collaborative writing of scientific documents. Using
GitHub as the central platform, we guide participants through a hands-on
workflow for writing, reviewing, and managing academic texts together.
Researchers familiar with Git/GitHub will learn how to extend their
skills beyond code to the entire research process. Those new to GitHub
will gain a practical introduction to this powerful tool and discover
how version control, issues, and pull requests can streamline research
from collaborative writing to project management. By the end of the
session, you will be able to:

* Manage a GitHub repository for a manuscript
* Use issues and pull-requests to coordinate writing and feedback
* Leverage branch-and-merge workflows to track revisions and enforce transparency


These skills will be acquired in a realistic context where all
participants work together on an actual research project.
