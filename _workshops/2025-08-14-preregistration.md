## Course Description

This workshop focuses on the evaluation and practical design of preregistrations for empirical research. Preregistration is widely used to improve the transparency and interpretability of confirmatory analyses, yet in practice its effectiveness depends strongly on a concept called producibility: the extent to which sufficient information is provided for you (or somebody else) to produce the study in a way that meaningfully constrains researcher degrees of freedom. 

The workshop starts by revisiting core principles underlying preregistration, with particular attention focused on the latest meta-research. The focus lies on common weaknesses observed in real preregistrations, including underspecified hypotheses and ambiguous decision rules.  Common misconceptions and limitations of preregistration are also discussed, with attention to when preregistration is (and is not) appropriate.

A substantial portion of the workshop is devoted to hands-on activities. Participants learn how to read, evaluate, and critique preregistrations. Through guided exercises, students identify ambiguous specifications and potential sources of remaining flexibility, from both an author and a reviewer perspective. In the practical sessions, participants work on drafting their own preregistrations using a structured template. Participants are encouraged to work with a study from their own research where possible. For those who do not yet have a suitable project, other studies are provided, allowing everyone to engage fully in the exercises. Participants receive feedback through peer discussion and instructor guidance, with emphasis on translating research questions into producible plans.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have a concrete understanding of how to design, evaluate, and write preregistrations, as well as practical experience applying these principles to real research scenarios.
